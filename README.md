#React Native Weather API


A mobile weather app using openweathermap.com API, made with and to help learn React Native. The app currently allows the user to retrieve current local weather conditions by geolocation. I will be updating soon to allow a user to search for weather conditions by city.


##To Do

1. Add search by city feature.
2. Add better app styling.
3. swap openweathermap.com icons for custom icons (sorry openweathermap, but those icons are not very pretty).
4. Add touch events to display additional data such as extended forecasts
